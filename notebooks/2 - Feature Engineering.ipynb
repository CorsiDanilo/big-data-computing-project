While the miners revenue more or less follows the price trend of Bitcoin itself (this is also thanks to the transaction fees that are distributed to the miners). The two biggest spikes in transaction fees are due to a combination of ASIC shortages, huge price increases of BTC outpacing difficulty and the sudden hashrate drop, resulting in slower block times, backlog of transactions and extra fees per block (20 - 21 April 2021) and the increase in demand for block space attributed to the increase in Ordinals (8 May 2023)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448269,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"xb-RqdrfLv98"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Network Activity\n","if SLOW_OPERATIONS:\n","  for key, value in network_activity.items():\n","    data_visualization(merged_df_pd, key, value)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Regarding Network Activity, we can see how this also increases as time goes by, a symbol that the Bitcoin protocol is becoming more and more popular and people are willing to pay to use it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448269,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"smotu8fBLv98"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Additional Features: Rate of change\n","if SLOW_OPERATIONS:\n","  first_pair = next(iter(additional_features.items()))\n","  data_visualization(merged_df_pd, first_pair[0], first_pair[1])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448269,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"kA5QQADhLv98"},"outputs":[],"source":["def sma_visualization(dataset, features, title):\n","  trace1 = go.Scatter(\n","      x = dataset['timestamp'],\n","      y = dataset[\"market-price\"].astype(float),\n","      mode = 'lines',\n","      name = \"Market price (usd)\"\n","  )\n","\n","  trace2 = go.Scatter(\n","      x = dataset['timestamp'],\n","      y = dataset[features[0][1]].astype(float),\n","      mode = 'lines',\n","      name = features[0][0]\n","  )\n","\n","  trace3 = go.Scatter(\n","      x = dataset['timestamp'],\n","      y = dataset[features[1][1]].astype(float),\n","      mode = 'lines',\n","      name = features[1][0]\n","  )\n","\n","  trace4 = go.Scatter(\n","      x = dataset['timestamp'],\n","      y = dataset[features[2][1]].astype(float),\n","      mode = 'lines',\n","      name = features[2][0]\n","  )\n","\n","  layout = dict(\n","      title=title,\n","      xaxis=dict(\n","          rangeselector=dict(\n","              buttons=list([\n","                  # Change the count to desired amount of months.\n","                  dict(count=1,\n","                      label='1m',\n","                      step='month',\n","                      stepmode='backward'),\n","                  dict(count=6,\n","                      label='6m',\n","                      step='month',\n","                      stepmode='backward'),\n","                  dict(count=12,\n","                      label='1y',\n","                      step='month',\n","                      stepmode='backward'),\n","                  dict(count=36,\n","                      label='3y',\n","                      step='month',\n","                      stepmode='backward'),\n","                  dict(step='all')\n","              ])\n","          ),\n","          rangeslider=dict(\n","              visible = True\n","          ),\n","          type='date'\n","      )\n","  )\n","\n","  data = [trace1, trace2, trace3, trace4]\n","\n","  fig = dict(data=data, layout=layout)\n","  iplot(fig, filename = title)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448270,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"wVsE5Ed_aZap"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Extract the short term SMA\n","short_term_sma = list(additional_features.items())[1:4]\n","print(short_term_sma)\n","\n","# Extract the long term SMA\n","long_term_sma = list(additional_features.items())[-3:]\n","print(long_term_sma)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448270,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"O45Snn4nLv99"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Additional Features: Short term SMA\n","if SLOW_OPERATIONS:\n","  sma_visualization(merged_df_pd, short_term_sma, \"Short term SMA (usd)\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1695386448270,"user":{"displayName":"Danilo Corsi","userId":"10800270661719155402"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"gFPGKfPXaXPb"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Additional Features: Long term SMA\n","if SLOW_OPERATIONS:\n","  sma_visualization(merged_df_pd,long_term_sma, \"Long term SMA (usd)\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["With regard to added features, we can see that the main price variations are in the medium to long term (months -
